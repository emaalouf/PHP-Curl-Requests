# PHP-Curl-Requests

I created this simple repo to help PHP developers who struggle with API requests to remember all the attributes that Curl requires.
After pulling an all-nighter trying to figure out where the token needs to be placed and how it needs to be done as well as JSONs, I wanted to stop the struggle and keep this repo forever
